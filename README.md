Simulating a Zombie Invasion
============================
Question: how quickly would the infection spread if zombies invaded?  Obviously it's important to understand the answer, 
so the problem should be simulated.

Here are the rules for how this program behaves:
- Humans are black dots
- Zombies are green dots
- Humans change to zombies if zombies touch them
- If a human gets close to a zombie, it runs away from it
- If a zombie gets close to a human, it walks towards it
- All other movement is random
